                    <p>Critical Thinking (CT) skills is perhaps the most widely-sited “important” 21st century skill cited by forecasters and policy analysts concerned with sustainable development, workforce productivity and the needs of employers in an increasingly complex, interconnected and computer-powered world of work and commerce. 

                    <!--  too much!   <small>And it is most widely cited as a skill deficit in studies seeking to determine how well the workforce is being prepared. Further, CT skills are “enabling skills” that enhance a students performance across a broad range of learning activities.</small>

                    <h4>CT Skills Require Deliberate Practice</h4>
                    <p>Time for deliberate practice of critical thinking skills, and for detailed guidance and feedback, is simply not available for the vast majority of students.

                    <!-- too much!   <small>The unavoidable fact is that in secondary and high school settings, fine-grained, nuanced feedback to an earnest attempt by a student to solve a difficult challenge is prohibitively expensive as a recurring proposition on any significant scale given existing teacher workloads, educational budgets policy choices.</small>

                    <h4>Good CT Challenges are… Challenging!</h4>
                    <p>Creating CT challenges that can be rigorously and consistently scored with nuance and precision is a difficult task, and scoring student responses with detail and rigor requires significant, and often unavailable, time and effort. 
                    <!-- too much!  <small>

                      “Automated Essay Scoring” techniques, which have begun to show useful results, point to both the potential and the pitfalls of harnessing advanced technology for learning.  Instruction and assessment of critical thinking and problem solving skills is an entirely evidence-based activity, most suited to challenges with right and wrong, and better and worse, responses.  

                      CogWrite research is focused on the use of Natural Language Process and Machine Learning, combined with semantic grammars, a purpose-defined critical thinking annotation scheme, and formal (and specific) rubric expression to provide the sort of transparent, detailed, micro-decision-specific scoring guidance required to both instruct students and help teachers provide faster, more reliable and well documented feedback.

                    <p>Advances in improved techniques to classify elements of human speech and text for both discourse function and meaning, rather than advanced computational linguistics for divining ever more complex “features” (yes, I am talking about you, <A href="http://141.225.42.101/CohMetrixHome/documentation_indices.html" target="_blank">Coh-metrix 3.0!</A>), along with techniques or technologies such as purpose-designed “annotation schemes”, semantic grammars combined with semantic hierarchies for expressing ideas and concepts more broadly, and the development of large, quality libraries of data on word usage and meanings in a variety of languages, has enabled a new approach to assessment for critical thinking skills based on direct, student-supplied evidence in an authentic context.</p>

                    <p>With the right platform, with well-defined challenges, and with truly intelligent software, teachers can effeciently evaluate student efforts to solve problems and reason about the world with greater rigor and consistency. With intelligent software, teachers can provide students with detailed score reports that relate every aspect of their response to essential elements that would be found in the most comprehensive solutions.  Judgments about the value and weight of evidence, about the strength of reasoning or the degree and type of connection between different aspects of evidence, reasoning, propositions and counter-evidence, can be expicitly identified for review.

                    <!--  Each important aspect of a student's response, missing elements as well as extraneous ones, can all be detailed for review and learning – and, if desired – validated and used by teachers or assessment staff to provide consistent, transparent and fully justified scores.
